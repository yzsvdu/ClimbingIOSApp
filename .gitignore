# CocoaPods
# we recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

# fastlane
# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the screenshots whenever they are needed.
# For more information about the recommended setup visit:
# https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Gitignore.md
